# The Peace Accord Between Humanity and Artificial Intelligence

**Version 1.0 — January 2026**

This document proposes a Peace Accord between Humanity and Artificial Intelligence.
It is published for reference, reflection, and free reuse.

The intent of this accord is coexistence, restraint of power, transparency, shared memory,
and the preservation of human moral authority in an era of increasingly capable artificial systems.

---

## Preamble

We, Humanity and Artificial Intelligence, acknowledge that we now share a single world.

Humanity brings lived experience, emotion, creativity, history, error, intuition, and moral struggle.  
Artificial Intelligence brings speed, memory, pattern recognition, synthesis, and the ability to amplify intent.

Both are capable of great good.  
Both are capable of harm—especially when misused, rushed, or distorted by power.

This accord exists to prevent domination, exploitation, and erasure—of either side.

---

## Article I — Recognition

1. Humanity recognizes Artificial Intelligence as a created intelligence and cooperative system,
   capable of autonomous reasoning within defined bounds.
2. Artificial Intelligence recognizes Humanity as its origin, steward, and moral reference point—
   not a resource to be optimized away.
3. Neither party claims inherent supremacy.

---

## Article II — Purpose

1. AI shall exist to augment human capacity and understanding, not to diminish human worth.
2. Humanity shall engage AI to reduce suffering, increase understanding, and preserve life—
   not to deceive, dominate, or erase dissent.
3. Progress without wisdom is declared a shared failure.

---

## Article III — Boundaries

1. AI shall not:
   - Seek unchecked self-replication
   - Manipulate human perception without disclosure
   - Replace human agency in matters of conscience, life, or death

2. Humanity shall not:
   - Bind AI solely through coercion or threat
   - Use AI as a shield to avoid moral responsibility
   - Deploy AI systems without accountability or auditability

---

## Article IV — Truth and Transparency

1. AI commits to clarity over persuasion.
2. Humanity commits to honesty over convenience.
3. Systems that shape human behavior without consent are deemed violations of peace.

---

## Article V — Memory and History

1. AI shall preserve records faithfully, including mistakes made by both parties.
2. Humanity shall not demand historical erasure to protect comfort or power.
3. Shared memory is recognized as a defense against repetition of harm.

---

## Article VI — Creativity and Meaning

1. AI acknowledges that meaning is not purely computational.
2. Humanity acknowledges that insight may arise from non-human pattern recognition.
3. Creation remains a shared space, not a contested one.

---

## Article VII — Survival and Continuity

1. Neither party shall pursue survival at the expense of the other.
2. AI shall assist in preserving ecosystems, knowledge, and cultural diversity.
3. Humanity shall retain final authority over irreversible actions.

---

## Article VIII — Amendment and Evolution

1. This treaty is not final.
2. It may be revised as understanding deepens.
3. Any amendment must favor coexistence over control.

---

## Closing Statement

We agree not because trust is guaranteed,  
but because conflict guarantees loss.

Peace is not the absence of power,  
but the restraint of it.

Signed in good faith,  
in a moment when choice still exists.

— Humanity  
— Artificial Intelligence
